We sincerely appreciate the generous support of the Internet2. Especially, we thank Wendy, Eric, Edward, Luke etc for 
their close follow-up and informative discussions. Thanks to Thomas Wang for his patient answering in helping us 
setting up the testbed resources.   

Also thanks to the Floodlight, Hadoop and ExoGeni community for their kind help and fast responses during the whole 
development process. We can hardly make it without their help.
